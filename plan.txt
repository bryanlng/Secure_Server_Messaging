Plan for new functionality:
I. Goal:
	-Be able to function out a group chat
	-That way, when one person sends out a message ==> everyone else gets it

II. Issues to think about:
	-What if 2 people send a message at same time?
	-What if 1 person is severely behind (like a few hours)? How will they 
	 see the messages that will be sent?

III. Design plan:
	-Have both:
		1) Another work queue
		2) Master log of the conversation
	1. Another work queue:
		-solves the problem of 2 people sending a message at the same time
		-when a person sends a message ==> create an item and add it to the work queue
		-I guess we can have 1 Thread be specifically delegated to work on this queue
		-Like the other Threads, it will block initially because it's empty, then upon an item
		 entering the queue:
			1) Grab the item and remove it from the queue
			2) Extract the string out
			3) Write it to the master log
			4) Then (somehow) broadcast it out to the other connections
	2. Master log:
		-solves the problem of 1 person being behind
		-Make every message have the following credentials:
			-Sender of message
			-Timestamp of time sent
			-Actual message
			-TCPStream*  (so that we're able to send and receive stuff)
		-Write stuff to the master log using Step 3) from above
			-Need to remember to lock here
		-Also, on the client side, keep a long that represents the timestamp of the last message received
		-Also, on the server side, keep a long that represents the timestamp of the most recent message
		 of the group chat
		-Thus, if the person is behind ==> client's timestamp < server timestamp, then:
			-Starting at the last instance of that timestamp, read messages from master log into client

IV. In total, all the data structures we have: 
	I. Server side:
		-Producer Thread
		-(x) # of Consumer Threads, which manage the connections
		-Work Queue 1, that manages the Consumer Threads 
		-Work Queue 2, which manages the messages
		-1 Thread to specifically manage Work Queue 2
		-Master log, which keeps track of all message sent
	II. Client side:


Problems:
	1. How to broadcast?
		-Means that every TCPStream* calls send()
		-Means that we need access to every Consumer Thread
			-Put them inside a list
			-So it would be a list of ConnectionHandler*

	2. Sending and receiving messages:
		-Case 1: Server receives message from client:
			-in what format should the stuff received be in???
			-because it'll be different between platforms (Java, C++, Android)
			-possibly change write()??:
				http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/write.2.html
				-because TCPStream's send() is actually calling write()
				-but write(int fd, const void *buf, size_t count) takes in a const void*,
				 it doesn't just have to be a const char* 
				-So we could make it point to a struct*, filled with all our stuff??
				-But the problem is, Java and Android don't have pointers
